                    No matter what the occasion, holiday, wedding, bridal shower, anniversary, baby shower, graduation,…surveys are split whether a favor is “necessary”.  However, the majority who believe that a favor is necessary also say that edible is better than something people may not use.  Favors can also add to the table décor. Looking for a favor can be exhausting.  Ambro-Sia’s will be able to work with you to match your theme with an edible favor made of baklava, kourambiedes, melomakarona, paximadakia, or koulourakia, in a variety of shapes (hearts, stars, bells, nautical, religious, …) and personalize your favor with your favorite picture or a simple imprint, ribbon, sticker.
