                We purchased the pastries for our wedding from Ambro-Sia's. Not only was Cia quick to respond to our inquiries and helpful in determining how many to purchase, but the pastries were delicious. The platters looked so delightful that half of the pastries had mysteriously disappeared before the cake cutting. Our guests, both Greek and not, were talking about how delicious the galaktoboureko was. The pastry was fresh, crispy, and had just the right amount of syrup. Overall Ambro-Sia's was great to work with and we will be ordering again next time Yia Yia is too busy to bake.

                We used Sia for my daughter's wedding in Columbus.  We wanted to have Greek pastries in addition to the wedding cake, and she came highly recommended (we got a referral from the Greek Cathedral in Columbus).  She made all types of Greek cookies and pastries.  I am 100 percent Greek, and everything tasted like my yia yia used to make.  She wrapped everything beautifully in cellophane and used fancy ribbons on each tray too.  It made quite a display.  She was wonderful to work with and very accommodating.  It felt like I was talking with a family member each time I spoke with her.  People raved about her desserts.  The wedding was at a country club, and her display of desserts added to the elegance.

                Cia’s baklava is made with the perfect blend of ingredients. The combination of nuts and honey make for a great gooey, finger-licking dessert.  My son’s favorite! And who knew that smoothing the baklava in chocolate would taste so good! An absolute must try if you have never had baklava before.

                Our wedding reception was divided into stations, one of which was a dessert station called "Yiayia's Kitchen" featuring Greek pastries.  Ambro-Sia's Greek Pastries provided our guests with a variety of homemade pastries that tasted just like the title of the station, "Yiayia's Kitchen."   There wasn't a single cookie left that night and a year later, everyone is still talking about the pastries at our wedding!  We highly recommend Sia Ragias Greek Pastries for all of your catering needs.
