        <p>Ambro-Sia's Greek Pastries, LLC was created to make Greek pastries available to people who are searching for pastries just like their mothers and grandmothers (yayades) made. Born and raised in Greece, I was exposed to the delicious Greek pastries from an early age and knew how the traditional pastries were made and tasted. Two of my favorite hobbies are cooking and baking. I bake every year during the holidays and I host a New Year's party for family and close friends. After retiring from teaching, I continued to bake and offered holiday gifts of my baklava and other pastries to family and friends. I use the finest ingredients and create the pastries without shortcuts or substitutes. As in teaching, I always preached "Practice Makes Perfect". I perfected my pastries and cookie recipes through practice, love and my secret ingredient -- my "passion" for baking.</p>
        <p>Giving gifts in beautiful boxes is equally important to me. My son, an industrial designer, designed the boxes that enhance the presentation of the pastries in a pleasing, appealing and attractive manner for gifts.</p>
        <p>Through family and friends, I was receiving calls to cater events. Individuals were happy with my pastries and cookies and raved how their guests enjoyed the taste, flavor and texture. These inquiries, along with my passion, inspired me to make my products available to the public by starting Ambro-Sia's Greek Pastries, LLC.</p>
        <p>Ambro-Sia's offers authentic old country family recipes which  include: baklava, melomakarona, kourambiedes, paximadia "Greek biscotti" (my personal creation), and koulourakia. I plan to offer additional pastries in the future, so continue to visit my web site.</p>
        <p>I welcome you to my site. Treat yourself, your family and friends with special Greek pastries for every occasion.</p>
